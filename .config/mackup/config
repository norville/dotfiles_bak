# If you want to specify another directory, you can use the "file_system"
# engine and Mackup won't try to detect any path for you: it will store your
# files where you explicitly told him to, using the "path" setting.

# The "path" setting is mandatory when using the "file_system" engine.
# Note: you don't need to escape spaces or wrap the path in quotes.
# The "path" can be absolute (from the / of your drive) or relative to your
# home directory.

# # or
# path = /some/folder/in/your/root
# # or
# path = /some path/in/your/root

# You can customize the directory name in which Mackup stores your file. By
# default, if not specified, Mackup creates a "Mackup" directory in the storage
# engine you chose, e.g. "~/Dropbox/Mackup".
